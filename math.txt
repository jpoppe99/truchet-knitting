Math for hats:
inputs:
sgauge: # of stitches for 4"
rgauge: # of rows for 4"
circumference: head cicumference (in inches)
length: length of crown (in inches)

Example data:
sgauge: 20
rgauge: 22
cicumference: 24"
length: 6"


*(circumference/4) * sgauge = width*
(24/4) * 20 = 120
width = 120

*(length/4) * rgauge = height*
(6/4) * 22 = 33
height = 33

It only allows multiples of 5 or 6 for number of stitches so you don't have to deal with random stitches
we can either add considerations for odd stitch counts or we can round up or down when mod for 5 or 6 doesn't equal 0
TriangleSlide: (# of triangles)
min = 4
max = 10

mod(width, min) 
mod(width, max)
choice = smallest
take smaller of two and decrease to that point for each set of pixels
(width/choice) - 1 = decreases
height - decreases = base (size of rect before decreases)


ie:
choice = 5 (since mod(120, 5) = 0) 
decreases = (120/5) - 1 = 23
base = 33 - 23 = 10


initial base = 10 (height) x 120 (width)
on top: x5 right triangles, 24 (width) x 23
